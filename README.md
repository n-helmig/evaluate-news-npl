The goal of this project is to create a website that uses the meaningcloud API to analyze articles/text and return the results


## Current status

Finished. In order to run open your command line equivalent navigate to the evaluate-news-nlp folder. Once there, use npm i to download all dependencies from the package.json. Once that is finished, use npm run prod to produce a dist folder and then npm run start to run the server. Website is located at localhost:8081.

If you wish to use the webpack dev instead, download all dependencies, use npm run prod, and then use npm run dev. This will open the development side which hot loads the page. Website is located at localhost:8080. Comment out the service workers in the html file to work more efficiently.
